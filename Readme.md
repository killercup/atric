# tic - Amazon Trade In Price Check

This small script queries Amazon(.com|.de|...) for the trade in value of the books you specify.

I wrote it because I wanted to trade stuff in but didn't want to settle for prices as low as EUR 0.10 and rather check if the values change over time.

## Usage

To use it, edit the `*.sample.yml` files to your liking and call them `*.yml`.

`books.yml` needs to be a list called `books` containing the ISBN numbers of the books you want to look up.

Running `coffee app.coffee` will return JSON data (or errors, I need to clean that up).
