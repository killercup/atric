# ATRIC Web API

This is the web server/JSON API for ATRIC.

## Features

Most features are implemented to make [the ATRIC web frontend][client] work.

It currently uses [`passport-twitter`][passport] for authentication (you need a Twitter
account to sign up/in) and the only access is via session cookie.

You can see the JSON API documentation by visiting `/api/` in your browser. Or just visit [the live version][api-docs].
